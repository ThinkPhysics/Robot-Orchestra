"""Robot orchestra abstractions.

Provides a simple language grammar for issuing beat patterns and playback
cue to Robot Orchestra instruments, and handles MQTT messaging to distribute
those commands.

Can be straightforwardly extended to simplify grammar, which we leave as an
exercise for workshop participants.

Requires `sudo pip install paho-mqtt` on a vanilla Raspbian install, as of
2017-06-17. Also `sudo apt install mosquitto`, if you want to run the broker
locally.
